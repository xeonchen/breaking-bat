# User Story: Data Storage and Management

## ID

data-persistence

## As a...

User

## I want to...

Have all my data automatically saved locally and be able to export/import game data

## So that I can...

Never lose my scoring data due to crashes or power loss, and manage my data across different devices or create backups

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC001**: All operations are automatically saved to local storage in real-time
- **AC002**: The app automatically loads the last unfinished game when I start the application
- **AC003**: I can export game data in both JSON and CSV formats
- **AC004**: I can import previously exported game data
- **AC005**: All data persists between browser sessions and app restarts
- **AC006**: The app works completely offline without any network connection
- **AC007**: Data export includes comprehensive game statistics and team information
- **AC008**: Import functionality validates data integrity before loading

## Priority

High

## Dependencies

- All other features (this provides the foundation for data persistence)

## Sub-stories

### Auto-save Functionality

- Every user action is immediately saved to IndexedDB
- No manual save required
- Prevents data loss from unexpected closures

### Session Recovery

- App detects incomplete games on startup
- Offers to resume the last unfinished game
- Preserves all game state including current inning, score, and lineup position

### Data Export

- Export individual games or entire seasons
- Support JSON format for complete data preservation
- Support CSV format for spreadsheet analysis
- Include metadata (game info, teams, players, statistics)

### Data Import

- Import previously exported JSON files
- Validate data structure and integrity
- Merge imported data with existing records
- Handle duplicate detection and resolution

### Offline Operation

- Complete functionality without internet connection
- Local data storage using IndexedDB
- Service Worker for offline app loading

## Notes

- This is critical for user trust and data reliability
- Must handle edge cases like storage quota limits
- Consider implementing data compression for large datasets
- Export format should be human-readable when possible
