# User Story: Comprehensive Rule Matrix System

## ID

## As a...

Softball Scoring Application System

## I want to...

Have a comprehensive rule validation system that understands all possible game scenarios and can provide guidance for valid scoring options while preventing invalid game states

## So that I can...

Ensure accurate and consistent scoring by automatically validating all batting results, base advancement scenarios, and RBI calculations according to official softball rules

## Acceptance Criteria

### Rule Validation Engine

- **AC001**: Given empty bases, all 13 standard hit types should be available (1B, 2B, 3B, HR, BB, IBB, SF, E, FC, SO, GO, AO, DP)
- **AC002**: Given runners on base, hit type availability should be filtered based on game situation (e.g., SF disabled without runners in scoring position)
- **AC003**: Given any base situation, double play options should only be available when runners can be forced out
- **AC004**: Given any scoring scenario, the system should automatically calculate correct RBI counts

### Base Advancement Logic

- **AC005**: Given a single (1B) with runners on base, the system should provide multiple valid advancement options based on actual gameplay
- **AC006**: Given a double (2B) with runners on base, the system should calculate probable advancement scenarios with corresponding RBI counts
- **AC007**: Given a triple (3B) with runners on base, all runners should advance to home with appropriate RBI calculation
- **AC008**: Given a home run (HR), all runners and the batter should score with automatic 4 RBI calculation for bases loaded

### Sacrifice Play Rules

- **AC009**: Given no runners in scoring position (2nd or 3rd base), sacrifice fly (SF) should be disabled
- **AC010**: Given runner(s) in scoring position, sacrifice fly should be enabled with automatic RBI calculation if runner scores
- **AC011**: Given runners on base, sacrifice bunt scenarios should be available with appropriate advancement options

### Error and Fielder's Choice Logic

- **AC012**: Given an error (E), the system should allow manual specification of base advancement for all runners
- **AC013**: Given a fielder's choice (FC), the system should track which runner was forced out and advancement of remaining runners
- **AC014**: Given defensive plays, RBI credits should follow official scoring rules (no RBI on FC that results in out)

### Advanced Scenarios

- **AC015**: Given bases loaded situation, the system should handle complex advancement scenarios for all hit types
- **AC016**: Given double play potential, the system should validate that proposed advancement combinations are physically possible
- **AC017**: Given any scoring play, the system should prevent impossible base advancement combinations
- **AC018**: Given multiple outcome options for a single at-bat result, the scorekeeper should be able to select what actually occurred

### Automatic Calculations

- **AC019**: Given any at-bat result, RBI count should be calculated automatically based on runners who score
- **AC020**: Given any base advancement, the system should update baserunner positions automatically
- **AC021**: Given any scoring play, team and game totals should be updated in real-time
- **AC022**: Given complex plays (e.g., runner thrown out trying to advance), the system should handle partial advancement scenarios

### Rule Compliance

- **AC023**: Given any proposed scoring combination, the system should validate against official softball scoring rules
- **AC024**: Given invalid combinations, the system should provide clear error messages explaining why the combination is not allowed
- **AC025**: Given edge cases (e.g., interference, weather delays), the system should handle special rule scenarios
- **AC026**: Given rule violations, the system should prevent saving invalid game states and require correction

## Priority

High

## Dependencies

- live-scoring (requires real-time validation during game play)
- data-persistence (must store validated results)
- Player and Team entities (for roster validation)

## Notes

- This is a foundational system component that ensures data integrity
- Must be thoroughly tested with comprehensive edge case coverage
- Should provide educational value by explaining rule applications
- Critical for maintaining accurate statistics and preventing scoring errors
