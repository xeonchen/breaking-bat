# User Story: Sample Data Management for Development and Testing

## ID

sample-data-management

## As a...

Developer, Tester, or New User

## I want to...

Load and manage sample data (teams with realistic players, seasons, and game types) to quickly populate the application for testing or demonstration

## So that I can...

Quickly set up the application with realistic test data for development, testing, or demonstration purposes without manually creating all entities

## Acceptance Criteria

### Sample Data Loading Interface

- **sample-data-management:AC001**: Given I am on the Settings page General tab, I should see a "Load Sample Data" button with a clear description
- **sample-data-management:AC002**: Given I click the "Load Sample Data" button, I should see a confirmation dialog explaining what will be created
- **sample-data-management:AC003**: Given I confirm loading sample data, the system should create comprehensive test data including teams, players, seasons, and game types
- **sample-data-management:AC004**: Given the loading process is in progress, the button should show a loading state and be disabled to prevent duplicate operations

### Sample Data Content and Quality

- **sample-data-management:AC005**: Given sample data is loaded, the system should create 3-5 teams with realistic team names and colors
- **sample-data-management:AC006**: Given teams are created, each team should have 12-15 players with realistic names, positions, and jersey numbers
- **sample-data-management:AC007**: Given seasons are created, the system should include 2-3 seasons with appropriate date ranges and names
- **sample-data-management:AC008**: Given game types are created, the system should include 5-7 common game types (Regular Season, Playoffs, Tournament, Scrimmage, etc.)

### Data Integrity and Conflict Management

- **sample-data-management:AC009**: Given sample data already exists, the system should not create duplicates and should handle existing data gracefully
- **sample-data-management:AC010**: Given existing data conflicts with sample data, the system should append numbers or modify names to avoid conflicts
- **sample-data-management:AC011**: Given the loading process fails, the system should not leave partially created data that could cause inconsistencies
- **sample-data-management:AC012**: Given data validation rules exist, sample data should comply with all application validation requirements

### User Feedback and Status

- **sample-data-management:AC013**: Given the sample data loading is successful, I should see a success notification with details of what was created
- **sample-data-management:AC014**: Given the sample data loading encounters an error, I should see an error notification with a helpful error message and suggestions
- **sample-data-management:AC015**: Given the loading process takes time, I should see progress indicators or status updates during the operation
- **sample-data-management:AC016**: Given the sample data is loaded, I should be able to immediately navigate to Teams, Games, and Seasons pages and see the created data

### Sample Data Management Options

- **sample-data-management:AC017**: Given I have loaded sample data, I should have the option to clear sample data specifically without affecting real data
- **sample-data-management:AC018**: Given I want to reload sample data, I should be able to replace existing sample data with fresh sample data
- **sample-data-management:AC019**: Given I need different scenarios, I should have options for different sample data sets (small team, large league, tournament, etc.)
- **sample-data-management:AC020**: Given sample data needs customization, I should be able to modify sample data parameters before loading

### Integration with Application Features

- **sample-data-management:AC021**: Given sample data is loaded, it should work seamlessly with all application features (lineup creation, game setup, scoring, etc.)
- **sample-data-management:AC022**: Given sample games might be helpful, the system should optionally create 1-2 sample games with lineups pre-configured
- **sample-data-management:AC023**: Given demonstration purposes, sample data should showcase the full range of application capabilities
- **sample-data-management:AC024**: Given new users need examples, sample data should include best practices for team and player setup

### Development and Testing Support

- **sample-data-management:AC025**: Given developers need testing data, sample data should include edge cases and boundary conditions
- **sample-data-management:AC026**: Given automated testing needs data, sample data loading should be available via API or programmatic interface
- **sample-data-management:AC027**: Given different testing scenarios are needed, multiple sample data sets should be available
- **sample-data-management:AC028**: Given performance testing is important, sample data should include large datasets for performance validation

## Priority

Low (Development/Testing utility)

## Dependencies

- app-settings (sample data loading accessed through settings interface)
- team-management (creates teams)
- roster-management (creates players and rosters)
- season-and-game-types (creates seasons and game types)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] DSL spec created and reviewed
- [ ] API contract defined
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code implementation complete
- [ ] All quality gates passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Primarily for development, testing, and demonstration purposes
- Should not interfere with production user data
- Sample data should be realistic and representative of actual use cases
- Consider different sample data sets for different use cases
- Important for onboarding new users who want to explore the application
- Should be easily reversible/removable to avoid cluttering real data
