# User Story: Application Framework and Core Infrastructure

## ID

app-framework

## As a...

Breaking-Bat User (Scorekeeper/Team Manager)

## I want to...

Have a reliable application framework with simplified navigation, offline capabilities, and automatic data persistence

## So that I can...

Focus on scoring games efficiently with a stable, intuitive interface that never loses my data

## Acceptance Criteria

### Streamlined Navigation and Interface

- **app-framework:AC001**: Navigation reduced from 7 to 4 main sections
- **app-framework:AC002**: Games page serves as the default landing page
- **app-framework:AC003**: Mobile navigation provides larger touch targets with 4 items instead of 5
- **app-framework:AC004**: All existing functionality remains accessible through intuitive navigation
- **app-framework:AC005**: Navigation is consistent across desktop and mobile devices

### Enhanced Mobile Experience

- **app-framework:AC006**: Bottom navigation provides 25% larger touch targets (4 items vs 5)
- **app-framework:AC007**: Games page optimized as mobile landing page
- **app-framework:AC008**: All interactions optimized for thumb navigation
- **app-framework:AC009**: Consistent experience across mobile and tablet sizes

### Automatic Data Persistence

- **app-framework:AC010**: All operations are automatically saved to local storage in real-time
- **app-framework:AC011**: The app automatically loads the last unfinished game when I start the application
- **app-framework:AC012**: All data persists between browser sessions and app restarts
- **app-framework:AC013**: The app works completely offline without any network connection
- **app-framework:AC014**: Auto-save prevents data loss from unexpected closures or crashes

### Data Export and Import

- **app-framework:AC015**: I can export game data in both JSON and CSV formats
- **app-framework:AC016**: I can import previously exported game data
- **app-framework:AC017**: Data export includes comprehensive game statistics and team information
- **app-framework:AC018**: Import functionality validates data integrity before loading
- **app-framework:AC019**: Export supports individual games or entire seasons

### Session Recovery and Offline Operation

- **app-framework:AC020**: App detects incomplete games on startup and offers to resume
- **app-framework:AC021**: Complete functionality available without internet connection
- **app-framework:AC022**: Service Worker enables offline app loading
- **app-framework:AC023**: Local data storage using IndexedDB for reliability

### Backward Compatibility and Data Preservation

- **app-framework:AC024**: All existing games, seasons, and game types remain functional
- **app-framework:AC025**: Games with assigned seasons/game types display correctly
- **app-framework:AC026**: Existing bookmarks and URLs redirect appropriately
- **app-framework:AC027**: Data migration is seamless and automatic
- **app-framework:AC028**: No loss of historical data or statistics

## Priority

High

## Dependencies

- All other features depend on this foundation for data persistence and navigation

## Definition of Done

- [ ] DSL spec created and reviewed
- [ ] API contract defined
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code implementation complete
- [ ] All quality gates passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- This provides the foundational infrastructure for all other features
- Critical for user trust and data reliability
- Must handle edge cases like storage quota limits
- Service Worker implementation required for true offline functionality
