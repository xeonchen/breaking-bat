Make player substitutions during live gameplay including pinch hitters, pinch runners, and defensive substitutions

## So that I can...

Accurately track player changes throughout the game while maintaining correct batting order and defensive assignments

## Acceptance Criteria

### Substitution Interface Access

- **player-substitutions:AC001**: Given a game is in progress, I should have access to substitution controls from the live scoring interface
- **player-substitutions:AC002**: Given I need to make a substitution, I should see a clear "Substitutions" button or menu

### Pinch Hitter Substitutions

- **player-substitutions:AC004**: Given it's a player's turn to bat, I should be able to substitute them with a pinch hitter
- **player-substitutions:AC005**: Given I select a pinch hitter, the original batter should be removed from the game
- **player-substitutions:AC006**: Given a pinch hitter completes their at-bat, they should remain in the game unless further substituted
- **player-substitutions:AC007**: Given a pinch hitter stays in the game, I should assign them a defensive position for the next half-inning

### Pinch Runner Substitutions

- **player-substitutions:AC008**: Given there's a runner on base, I should be able to substitute them with a pinch runner
- **player-substitutions:AC009**: Given I select a pinch runner, they should immediately replace the original runner at the same base
- **player-substitutions:AC010**: Given a pinch runner is inserted, the original runner should be removed from the game
- **player-substitutions:AC011**: Given a pinch runner scores or advances, they should remain active in the batting order

### Defensive Substitutions

- **player-substitutions:AC012**: Given the inning changes to defense, I should be able to make defensive substitutions
- **player-substitutions:AC013**: Given I make a defensive substitution, I should assign the new player to a specific position
- **player-substitutions:AC014**: Given a defensive substitution occurs, the new player should be placed in the batting order at the appropriate position
- **player-substitutions:AC015**: Given multiple defensive changes occur, I should be able to make them all before confirming

### Substitution Validation and Rules

- **player-substitutions:AC016**: Given a player has been removed from the game, they should not be available for re-entry
- **player-substitutions:AC017**: Given all bench players have been used, the substitution interface should indicate no substitutions available
- **player-substitutions:AC018**: Given I attempt an invalid substitution, I should receive clear error messages explaining the rules
- **player-substitutions:AC019**: Given substitution rules are violated, the system should prevent the invalid change

### Batting Order Management

- **player-substitutions:AC020**: Given a substitution occurs, the batting order should be maintained correctly
- **player-substitutions:AC021**: Given a player is substituted before their at-bat, the substitute should bat in that same position
- **player-substitutions:AC022**: Given a player is substituted after their at-bat, they should be replaced in the batting order for future at-bats
- **player-substitutions:AC023**: Given multiple substitutions occur, the batting order should remain consistent and logical

### Substitution History and Tracking

- **player-substitutions:AC024**: Given substitutions are made, they should be recorded with inning and circumstances
- **player-substitutions:AC025**: Given I want to review substitutions, I should be able to see a substitution log for the game
- **player-substitutions:AC026**: Given substitutions affect statistics, player stats should be correctly attributed to the right players
- **player-substitutions:AC027**: Given the game ends, the final lineup should reflect all substitutions made during the game

### Integration with Game Flow
