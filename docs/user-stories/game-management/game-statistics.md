View real-time game statistics, box score, and running totals during live gameplay

## So that I can...

Monitor game progress, track player performance, and provide accurate statistics to coaches and players during the game

## Acceptance Criteria

### Real-Time Box Score Display

- **game-statistics:AC001**: Given a game is in progress, I should see a live box score with runs by inning for both teams
- **game-statistics:AC002**: Given runs are scored, the box score should update immediately in real-time
- **game-statistics:AC003**: Given the current inning changes, the active inning should be highlighted in the box score
- **game-statistics:AC004**: Given the game progresses, running totals should be calculated and displayed automatically

### Team Statistics Summary

- **game-statistics:AC005**: Given I want to view team stats, I should see team totals for runs, hits, errors, and other key statistics
- **game-statistics:AC006**: Given the game is ongoing, team statistics should update with each recorded play
- **game-statistics:AC007**: Given both teams are playing, I should be able to view statistics for both my team and the opponent
- **game-statistics:AC008**: Given innings are completed, I should see statistics broken down by inning when relevant

### Individual Player Statistics

- **game-statistics:AC009**: Given I want to check player performance, I should see individual batting statistics for all players
- **game-statistics:AC010**: Given a player has multiple at-bats, their statistics should accumulate correctly throughout the game
- **game-statistics:AC011**: Given substitutions occur, statistics should be correctly attributed to the right players
- **game-statistics:AC012**: Given the game progresses, I should see key stats like batting average, on-base percentage, and RBIs

### Batting Statistics Tracking

- **game-statistics:AC013**: Given players have at-bats, I should see individual stats for hits, runs, RBIs, walks, strikeouts
- **game-statistics:AC014**: Given a player gets different hit types, their statistics should reflect singles, doubles, triples, and home runs separately
- **game-statistics:AC015**: Given advanced statistics are important, I should see on-base percentage and slugging percentage calculations
- **game-statistics:AC016**: Given situational performance matters, I should see stats with runners in scoring position when available

### Pitching Statistics (if applicable)

- **game-statistics:AC017**: Given pitchers are tracked, I should see pitching statistics including innings pitched and earned runs
- **game-statistics:AC018**: Given multiple pitchers are used, statistics should be tracked separately for each pitcher
- **game-statistics:AC019**: Given pitching changes occur, the current pitcher should be clearly indicated
- **game-statistics:AC020**: Given pitching performance matters, I should see WHIP, ERA, and strikeout totals

### Statistical Interface and Navigation

- **game-statistics:AC021**: Given statistics are complex, I should be able to switch between different statistical views easily
- **game-statistics:AC022**: Given I need quick access, statistics should be available from the main scoring interface
- **game-statistics:AC023**: Given screen space is limited, statistics should be organized in collapsible sections or tabs
- **game-statistics:AC024**: Given mobile devices are used, the statistics display should be optimized for smaller screens

### Export and Sharing Statistics

- **game-statistics:AC025**: Given the game is complete, I should be able to export detailed game statistics
- **game-statistics:AC026**: Given statistics need to be shared, I should be able to generate a printable box score
- **game-statistics:AC027**: Given digital sharing is preferred, I should be able to export statistics in common formats (PDF, CSV)
- **game-statistics:AC028**: Given social sharing might be desired, I should be able to generate summary statistics for sharing

### Historical Context and Comparisons

- **game-statistics:AC029**: Given season statistics exist, I should see how current game performance compares to season averages
- **game-statistics:AC030**: Given player history is available, I should see career or season statistics alongside current game stats
- **game-statistics:AC031**: Given team performance matters, I should see team statistics in context of season performance
- **game-statistics:AC032**: Given statistical trends are important, I should see recent performance trends when available

### Real-Time Updates and Accuracy

- **game-statistics:AC033**: Given statistics are critical, all calculations should be accurate and update in real-time
- **game-statistics:AC034**: Given errors in scoring occur, statistics should recalculate correctly when plays are corrected
- **game-statistics:AC035**: Given the game state changes, statistics should reflect the current accurate state of the game
- **game-statistics:AC036**: Given performance matters, statistics calculations should not slow down the scoring interface

### Integration with Game Management

- **game-statistics:AC037**: Given statistics are part of the game record, they should integrate with overall game data
- **game-statistics:AC038**: Given games are saved, statistics should be preserved as part of the permanent game record
- **game-statistics:AC039**: Given multiple games exist, individual game statistics should contribute to cumulative season statistics
- **game-statistics:AC040**: Given reporting is needed, game statistics should integrate with broader reporting features

## Priority

Medium

## Dependencies

- live-game-scoring (statistics are generated from scoring data)
- player-substitutions (substitutions affect statistical attribution)
- roster-management (requires player data for statistical tracking)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] DSL spec created and reviewed
- [ ] API contract defined
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Code implementation complete
- [ ] All quality gates passed
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Notes

- Statistics accuracy is critical for competitive play
- Real-time updates essential for live game use
- Interface should be informative but not overwhelming during gameplay
- Consider different statistical needs for different types of users (coaches, players, fans)
- Export functionality important for post-game analysis and record-keeping
- Performance optimization important to avoid slowing down primary scoring interface
