## Critical Issues Found

### Test Violations Detected

Our test validation tool found **1 active violation**:

**AtBatRepository.test.ts Line 22:**

```
Before: (player1, null, player3)  # First and third
Hit: 2B (Double)
After: (batter, player1, null)   # Batter on first, player1 on second
RBIs: 1, Runs: [player3]
```

**Issue**: This scenario shows the batter reaching first base on a double, which violates basic hit type rules. Doubles should put the batter on second base initially.

**Possible Explanations**:

1. Test data error - should be coded as single (1B) not double (2B)
2. Special scenario representing double + defensive error (but should still be coded as 2B)
3. Test represents invalid scenario that should be rejected

**Note**: According to Taiwan slow-pitch rules, hit type is determined by initial result, not final position after errors. Even if error allows additional advancement, the hit remains classified by its original outcome.

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 Completion (Target: Next Sprint)

1. **Fix first_third violations** - Resolve the test violation
2. **Validate first_third implementation** - Expert review of all 13 scenarios
3. **Add comprehensive tests** - Unit tests for first_third configuration

### Phase 2 Implementation (Target: Following Sprint)

**Priority Order:**

1. **`third_only`** - Critical for sacrifice fly scenarios
2. **`second_only`** - Common scoring position
3. **`loaded`** - Maximum impact scenarios (grand slams, etc.)
4. **`first_second`** - Complex force play scenarios
5. **`second_third`** - Specialized scoring scenarios

### Success Metrics

- **100% test coverage** for each base configuration
- **Zero rule violations** in validation tool
- **Expert approval** of all rule scenarios
- **Performance targets met** (< 50ms lookup time)

## Testing Status

### Automated Testing

- **Unit Tests**: 25/104 scenario groups covered
- **Integration Tests**: 0/8 base configurations covered
- **Validation Tool**: ✅ Active and detecting violations
- **Performance Tests**: ❌ Not implemented

### Expert Validation

- **Softball Rules Expert Review**: ❌ Pending
- **Real-world Scenario Testing**: ❌ Pending
- **Edge Case Verification**: ❌ Pending

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items

1. **Incomplete rule coverage** - Users may encounter unhandled scenarios
2. **Test violations** - Existing tests may contain rule errors
3. **Performance concerns** - 104 scenarios may impact lookup speed
4. **Expert validation** - Rules may not match real softball gameplay

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Complete Phase 1** before UI implementation
2. **Comprehensive testing** at each step
3. **Expert review** of all implemented rules
4. **Performance benchmarking** during implementation
