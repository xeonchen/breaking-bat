```

## Mobile User Experience Analysis

### Current Mobile Experience Issues

```
Bottom Navigation (5 items):
🏠 Home | 👥 Teams | 📅 Seasons | ⚾ Game | 📊 Stats

Problems:
- Cramped spacing (5 items on small screens)
- Home tab serves no functional purpose
- Seasons tab for infrequent configuration task
- Inconsistent primary workflow access
```

### Proposed Mobile Experience

```
Bottom Navigation (4 items):
👥 Teams | ⚾ Games | 📊 Stats | ⚙️ Settings

Improvements:
- 25% more space per item (better touch targets)
- Games as default = faster primary workflow
- Settings consolidation improves discoverability
- Cleaner visual hierarchy
```

### Mobile Task Flow Comparison

#### Scoring a Game (Mobile)

```
Current: Home(tap) → Games(tap) → Create/Find(tap) → Start(tap) → Score
Steps: 5 taps, 4 page loads

Proposed: Games(default) → Create/Find(tap) → Start(tap) → Score
Steps: 3 taps, 2 page loads

Improvement: 40% fewer taps, 50% fewer page loads
```

## Cognitive Load Analysis

### Current Mental Model

```
User's Mental Map:
- Home = Dashboard (but provides little value)
- Teams = Player management
- Seasons = Time periods (top-level importance?)
- Game Types = Categories (top-level importance?)
- Games = The actual games
- Stats = Results viewing
- Settings = Basic app config

Cognitive Issues:
- 7 top-level concepts to remember
- Unclear hierarchy (are seasons/types as important as games?)
- Home page creates "where am I?" confusion
```

### Proposed Mental Model

```
User's Mental Map:
- Games = Primary workflow (default landing)
- Teams = Player/roster management
- Stats = Results and analysis
- Settings = All configuration (seasons, types, app preferences)

Cognitive Benefits:
- 4 clear, distinct concepts
- Obvious hierarchy (Games primary, others secondary)
- Logical grouping reduces decision fatigue
```
